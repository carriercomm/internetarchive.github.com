This week, Daniel released version 1 of [the roboblogger](http://github.com/dmontalvo/roboblogger)! Several Internet Archive blogs are now being aggregated at [The Internet Archive News Blog](http://ianews.wordpress.com/), with hourly updates through cron. He is starting to work on various bug fixes and improvements, including implementation of an sqlite database to store blog posts.
