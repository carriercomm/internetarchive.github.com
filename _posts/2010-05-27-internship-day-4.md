Daniel is on a roll! Today, he finished all the lessons in *Learn Python the Hard Way*
and started work on [the roboblogger](http://github.com/dmontalvo/roboblogger),
his first open source project! The roboblogger (as named by Sam) will be an
rss/atom feed aggregator that populates a Wordpress blog. He has already
[spec-ed out the internals](http://wiki.github.com/dmontalvo/roboblogger/).

Daniel will learn about the [Universal FeedParser](http://feedparser.org/),
sqlite, cron, and the wordpress api. This will also be Daniel's first python
project, and we will discuss open source licenses.

The first use of this project will be to aggregate the many IA blogs into a
single news portal. Currently, we have posts on:

* internetarchive.wordpress.com
* opencontentalliance.org
* words.nasaimages.org
* blog.openlibrary.org
* openbookalliance.org
* iawebarchiving.wordpress.com
* [Brewster's "blog"](http://www.archive.org/iathreads/forum-display.php?forum=announcements)
* internetarchive.github.com (this blog)
* various twitter, facebook, and myspace accounts
* probably even more

When we have an Open Library dev instance set up, we hope Daniel write an OL bot
using some of the skills he learned for this project.
