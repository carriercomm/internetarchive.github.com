The BookServer group is excited to have an intern this summer! Our intern,
Daniel, is a computer science student who will be starting his third year of
studies in the fall. We are lucky to have him on board!

We have three goals for Daniel's internship:

* Learn software engineering from a Unix perspective.
* Learn the linux stack and the open source tools we use to build Internet Archive projects.
* Create and contribute to several open source projects.

Day 1 was very successful! We started on the basics of Unix development:

* Set up desk
* Set up Ubuntu workstation and get familiar with linux
* Set up archive.org email account
* Set up unix account!
* Create user accounts:
    * archive.org
    * openlibrary.org
    * launchpad.net
    * github.com
    * archive wiki

This week we plan on learning enough about the GNU toolchain to be able to 
start working on some archive.org projects. We will focus on learning linux, git,
python this week.
