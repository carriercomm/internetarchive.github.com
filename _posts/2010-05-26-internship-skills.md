We hope by the end of the summer, we can meet the [three goals](/bookserver/intern/2010/05/24/internship-day1.html)
that we set for the internship.

In the course of meeting these goals, we hope to teach the following skills:

* High-level skills
    * Unix, focusing on **linux**
    * The open-source software development stack in general
    * software engineering practices not covered in computer science
    * high-scalability and clustering
    * digital preservation
    * Internet research skills
* Other skills and tools
    * **python**
    * **git**
    * javascript
    * databases
    * software testing
    * emacs and other unix text editors
    * ssh

Daniel continued his impressive streak of productivity into Day #3, and has
now [completed 24 lessons](http://github.com/dmontalvo/learningpython/) from
Learning Python The Hard Way. Today, we also had lunch on the beach!
