Day #2 of the summer internship was quite productive! Today, Daniel managed to 
*learn both python and git*, which is very impressive! He also:

* learned how to connect to our unix server using ssh
* generate ssh keys
* create a new git repository
* edit files with emacs
* commit changed files using git
* push changes to github

He also worked through the [first four exercises](http://github.com/dmontalvo/learningpython/)
in the Leaning Python the Hard Way tutorial and checked them in.
